This is a very simple demonstration of a minimal unit test suite.
It was created as a practice exercise before delivering an internal
TDD course.

I am placing this code in the public domain -- do with it as you will!

I really don't suggest that you use this in practice, or take it any
further. The main point was to demonstrate the fundamentals of unit
testing -- but also to show all of the other things that the well-known
test suites such as JUnit and Spock give you. On the other hand, it's
quite nice to be able to use Java 8 lambdas for a change.
